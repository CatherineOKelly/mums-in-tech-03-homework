# Mums in Tech - Week 03 Homework

This week we covered CSS and so the homework this week is to increase
your exposure to different CSS properties.

**The task is to modify the CSS of the provided website to give it your
own ideas/style with minimal changes to the HTML**

I will give bonus points to anyone who can figure out how to:

- Fork this repository
- Make changes to their forked version
- Create a pull request with your changes

For help with the above you can check out: **[Contributing to a GitHub project][contrib]**

## Intended Outcomes

- Learning about additional CSS properties
- Introduction to yet more HTML elements
- Further introduction to Git (working with others)
